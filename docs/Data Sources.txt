This data set was produced by the United States Census Bureau and obtained via the American Fact Finder website.  Each U.S. County’s total population data was obtained.  Data regarding race was also obtained.  The total population was broken down into these racial attributes: White, Black, American Indian, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Multi Race.  The sum of all of the racial attributes would equal the total population, so each individual would only be included in one of the racial attributes.  All of this data comes from the 2015 ACS 1-year estimates.
